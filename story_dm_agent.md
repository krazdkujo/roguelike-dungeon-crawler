   - Validate balance and progression fit
   - Document testing results

4. **Approval Phase**
   - Submit detailed content specifications
   - Include balance analysis and testing results
   - Wait for approval before proceeding

5. **Implementation Phase**
   - Merge approved content to master databases
   - Request artwork from ðŸŽ® UI/UX Game Designer
   - Request backend coding from ðŸŸ¡ Backend Developer
