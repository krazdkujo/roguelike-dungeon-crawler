## üö® CURRENT ISSUES TO RESOLVE AFTER RESTART

### CRITICAL PORT CONFIGURATION ISSUES ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status: 500 Errors on Authentication Endpoints**

**Problem Identified:**
- Port conflicts preventing proper server communication
- Proxy configuration mismatches between frontend and backend
- Multiple server instances causing conflicts

**Configuration After Restart:**
- Backend Server: Port 3005 (updated in simple-server.js)
- Frontend Server: Port 3003 (or first available port)
- Proxy Target: http://localhost:3005

---

## üéØ RESTART RECOVERY STEPS

### 1. Verify Project Integrity ‚úÖ
**Check Current System State:**
```bash
cd "C:\Dev\Testing the Agent Swarm"

# Verify key files exist
dir WINDOWS_RESTART_CHECKLIST.md  # This recovery guide
dir server\src\simple-server.js   # Backend with all APIs (PORT 3005)
dir client\vite.config.ts         # Frontend config (proxy to 3005)
dir .git\                          # Git repository
dir .gitignore                     # Repository configuration
```

### 2. Start Servers with Correct Configuration ‚ö°
**STEP-BY-STEP SERVER STARTUP:**

**Terminal 1 - Backend (Port 3005):**
```bash
cd "C:\Dev\Testing the Agent Swarm\server"
node src/simple-server.js
# Should show: üöÄ Server running on port 3005
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend (Port 3003):**
```bash
cd "C:\Dev\Testing the Agent Swarm\client"
npm run dev
# Should show: Local: http://localhost:3003/
```

**Access Application:** http://localhost:3003
**API Endpoint Test:** http://localhost:3005/health

**Note:** Vite proxy automatically forwards /api calls from 3003 to 3005

### 3. Git Repository Status ‚úÖ
**Repository is ready for GitHub:**
```bash
git status                    # Check current status
git log --oneline -5         # View recent commits
git remote -v                # Check if GitHub remote exists
```

**Ready for:** `git push origin main` (after adding GitHub remote)
