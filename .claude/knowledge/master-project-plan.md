## Critical Dependencies & Coordination

### Content-Visual Integration Points
1. **Monster Creation â†’ Sprite Production**: Content must be finalized before visual asset creation
2. **Equipment Design â†’ Character Visualization**: Equipment stats must align with visual representation
3. **Skill Effects â†’ Animation System**: Skill mechanics must be defined before effect animations
4. **Boss Mechanics â†’ Environmental Design**: Boss abilities must inform background requirements

### Technical Dependencies
1. **Database Schema**: Content expansion requires schema updates before implementation
2. **API Endpoints**: New content systems need corresponding API development
3. **Real-time Sync**: Multiplayer content requires WebSocket protocol updates
4. **Performance**: Asset loading optimization must keep pace with content expansion

### Team Coordination Schedule
**Weekly Sync Meetings**: Tuesdays 10:00 AM
- Progress review across all workstreams
- Dependency resolution and blocking issue discussion
- Next week priority alignment

**Sprint Reviews**: End of each 2-week period
- Deliverable validation and acceptance
- Technical debt assessment
- Timeline adjustment if needed
