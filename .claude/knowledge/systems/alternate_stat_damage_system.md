# Alternative Stat & Damage System: Resonance Constellation Matrix

## System Overview

The **Resonance Constellation Matrix (RCM)** represents a revolutionary departure from traditional numeric stat systems, utilizing trigonometric harmony and frequency resonance to create character capabilities and combat mechanics.

### Core Philosophy
Instead of linear numerical progression, characters exist as **living frequency generators** whose capabilities emerge from harmonic relationships between six fundamental resonance frequencies.

---

## Mathematical Foundation

### Resonance Frequencies
Each character possesses six **Resonance Frequencies** measured in degrees (0-360°):

1. **Vigor Resonance** (Red) - Physical power and endurance
2. **Flow Resonance** (Blue) - Adaptability and healing
3. **Mind Resonance** (Yellow) - Intelligence and magical power
4. **Swift Resonance** (Green) - Speed and precision
5. **Spirit Resonance** (Purple) - Leadership and inspiration
6. **Shadow Resonance** (Gray) - Subterfuge and chaos

### Harmonic Calculation System

#### Action Success Formula:
```
Success_Value = Base_Frequency + Σ(Harmonic_Bonuses) + Environmental_Modulation

Where:
Harmonic_Bonus = sin(Frequency_Difference / 60°) × Resonance_Strength
Environmental_Modulation = cos(Environmental_Phase - Character_Phase) × 0.3
```

#### Phase Alignment Bonuses:
- **Perfect Harmony** (0° difference): +100% effectiveness
- **Consonant Harmony** (60°, 120° difference): +50% effectiveness  
- **Neutral** (90° difference): No bonus
- **Dissonance** (45°, 135° difference): -25% effectiveness
- **Perfect Discord** (180° difference): -50% effectiveness

## Character Creation & Customization

### Constellation Building
Players create characters through **Interactive Constellation Mapping**:

1. **Primary Resonance Selection**: Choose dominant frequency (highest amplitude)
2. **Harmonic Distribution**: Distribute 1800° total across six frequencies (minimum 100° each)
3. **Phase Alignment**: Set initial phase relationships between frequencies
4. **Constellation Pattern**: Visual star pattern emerges from frequency relationships

### Visual Representation

## Combat Mechanics

### Action Resolution

#### Attack Actions:
1. Calculate **Primary Resonance** (Vigor + Swift harmonics)
2. Apply **Environmental Phase Modulation** based on dungeon resonance
3. Check **Target Frequency Interference** for defense calculation
4. Apply **Team Harmony Bonuses** from allied resonances

#### Damage Calculation:
```
Damage = Primary_Resonance × Harmonic_Multiplier × Environmental_Factor × Critical_Resonance

Where:
Primary_Resonance = (Vigor_Frequency + Swift_Frequency) / 2
Harmonic_Multiplier = 1 + (Team_Harmony_Bonus × 0.01)
Environmental_Factor = 0.7 to 1.3 based on dungeon resonance alignment
Critical_Resonance = 2.0 if perfect harmonic alignment (rare occurrence)
```

#### Defense Mechanics:
- **Resonance Shielding**: High Flow + Spirit frequencies create defensive harmonics
- **Frequency Damping**: Characters can modulate frequencies to absorb incoming damage
- **Harmonic Redirection**: Perfect timing allows damage reflection through phase inversion

### Team Collaboration

#### Collaborative Resonance:
- **Harmonic Amplification**: Team members with complementary frequencies boost each other
- **Resonance Lending**: Players can temporarily share frequency strength for powerful abilities
- **Constellation Fusion**: Ultimate abilities require synchronized team constellation alignment

#### Environmental Interaction:
- **Dungeon Resonance**: Each area has dominant frequencies affecting all calculations
- **Resonance Nodes**: Interactive environmental elements that modify local frequencies
- **Harmonic Puzzles**: Doors and obstacles requiring specific team frequency combinations

    }, 0);
    
    return crypto.createHash('sha256')
