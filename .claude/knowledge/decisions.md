- SNES visual authenticity preserved at 95% consistency
- Weekly cross-team coordination meetings mandatory

#### Resource Allocation
- Content Development: 30% team effort
- Visual Asset Production: 40% team effort
- Technical Integration: 30% team effort

#### Success Metrics
- 15+ unique monster types by Phase 1 completion
- 5-tier equipment system implemented  
- 8+ skills per character class
- Dynamic loot generation operational

#### Risks Accepted
- **Medium Risk**: Phase 4 complexity may require additional development time
