- Mastery Components: 25% of total power (specialization reward)  
- Synthesis Actions: 10% of total power (mastery combination reward)
- Equipment Resonance: 5% of total power (gear progression incentive)
```

#### **Progression Pacing**:

**Early Game** (Total Power 100-300):
- Focus on base skill development across multiple areas
- First mastery components unlock, providing specialization options
- Equipment resonance begins to matter
- Simple dual-skill synthesis actions become available

**Mid Game** (Total Power 301-600):
- Mastery components become primary progression focus
- Multiple mastery combinations create build diversity
- Equipment resonance significantly affects combat effectiveness
- Triple-skill synthesis actions unlock advanced capabilities

**Late Game** (Total Power 601-900):
- Advanced mastery components define character identity
- Complex synthesis actions create unique gameplay experiences
- Equipment transcendence provides legendary capabilities
- Multi-character coordination becomes essential for highest-level content

**Endgame** (Total Power 901-1200+):
- Mastery transcendence unlocks reality-affecting abilities
- Universal synthesis actions allow creative problem solving
- Legendary equipment provides story-level powers
- Teaching and mentorship become primary progression methods

### **Accessibility Balance**:

#### **Skill Floor vs. Skill Ceiling**:

**Low Skill Floor**: 
- Basic competency achievable through normal gameplay
- Mastery components unlock naturally through play style
- Equipment resonance provides automatic benefits
- Simple synthesis actions are discoverable through experimentation

**High Skill Ceiling**:
- Master-level play requires deep understanding of mastery interactions
- Advanced synthesis combinations reward system knowledge
- Equipment transcendence requires long-term commitment
- Teaching others requires complete mastery understanding

#### **Choice Complexity Management**:

**Progressive Complexity**:
- Early levels: Limited choices prevent decision paralysis
- Mid levels: Clear mastery paths with obvious benefits
- Late levels: Complex interactions for advanced players
- Master levels: Nearly unlimited combination possibilities

**Guidance Systems**:
- **Mastery Advisor**: NPCs suggest mastery paths based on play style
- **Synthesis Predictor**: Shows potential synthesis actions from current masteries
- **Community Knowledge**: Player-shared mastery guides and build templates
- **Adaptive Recommendations**: System learns from successful player combinations

### **Multiplayer Balance**:

#### **Solo vs. Group Power Scaling**:

**Solo Benefits**:
- Masteries develop 15% faster when playing alone
- Solo-specific synthesis actions provide self-sufficiency
- Equipment resonance bonuses are 10% stronger for solo players
- Crisis evolution triggers more frequently during solo play

**Group Benefits**:
- Party synergies provide capabilities impossible in solo play
- Teaching and learning accelerate mastery development
- Collaborative synthesis actions exceed individual player capabilities
- Group achievements unlock exclusive mastery branches

#### **Cross-System Integration**:
- Adaptive Mastery players provide **organic expertise** to mixed parties
- Can teach practical skills and mastery applications
- Synthesis actions complement Constellation Network strategic planning
- Equipment resonance helps optimize party gear distribution
